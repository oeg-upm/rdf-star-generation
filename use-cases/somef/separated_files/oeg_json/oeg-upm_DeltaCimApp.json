Besides allowing the access of remote infrastructures, the CIM implements a semantic interoperability layer, which translates heterogeneous payloads into JSON-LD modelled with the DELTA ontology by means of interoperability modules. The translation is bidirectional, therefore, when needed the CIM also translates from JSON-LD to a set of heterogeneous formats that follow different  models. This potentially leads to having systems developed with different standards communicating transparently. \nAdditionaly, the CIM allows to consume the data of a local infrastructure using SPARQL queries, or, consume the data from the cloud, i.e., the peer-to-peer network, with SPARQL queries. Other functionalities implemented are: validation of payloads using SHACL shapes on the fly, access control list, jwt token authentication for local infrastructures to interact with the CIM, a GUI for configuring the CIM, and a documented REST API to use the CIM.\n \n**All the current CIM releases send data about the status of the service to a private secured monitor service, that analyses the health of the services and prevents from potential attacks**\n \n",
