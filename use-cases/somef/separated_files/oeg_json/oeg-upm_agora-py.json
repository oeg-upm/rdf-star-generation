Basically, it tries to find out the domain and range of all properties in the vocabulary with the aim of identifying the set of nodes and edges that make up such link graph. In the end, (a subset of) concepts and properties in the ontology become the nodes and edges of the link graph, respectively.\n \nThe Fountain accepts vocabularies for registration in two different formats: Turtle and RDF/XML. In order to identify the only ontology that should be described in the submitted content, the Fountain parses it and queries the resulting graph with:\n```sql\nSELECT ?o WHERE {\n    ?o a owl:Ontology FILTER (isURI(?o))\n}\n```\n \n",

            "excerpt": "Thus, there are some rules that must be taken into account in order to let the Fountain *detect* nodes in ontologies. That is, nodes are all URIs that match at least one of the following: \n* It is a class, either an `owl:Class` or a `rdfs:Class`.\n* It has at least one subclass in the ontology or it is the superclass of any other.\n* It belongs to the domain of a datatype property.\n* Given an object property,\n    * it is a class that belongs to its range or/and domain.\n    * there may be a set of things for which such property may have values of it. \nIt is important to note that no automatic reasoning is performed in this process. All required information must be materialized in the ontology description that is being submitted. Furthermore, existing conflicts and/or inconsistencies in definitions will not be treated; neither a warning nor an error message will be generated.\n \nSimilarly to the process of node extraction, the detection of *valid* edges for the link graph in an ontology is built on the following query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE {\n    { ?p a rdf:Property }\n    UNION\n    { ?p a owl:ObjectProperty }\n    UNION\n    { ?p a owl:DatatypeProperty }\n    UNION\n    {\n        [] a owl:Restriction ;\n           owl:onProperty ?p .\n    }\n    FILTER(isURI(?p))\n}\n```\n \nThe result set of the corresponding query is composed of all the URIs that have been described in such a way that they can be considered as edges. The corresponding matching rules for edges are: \n* It is a `rdf:Property`, an `owl:ObjectProperty` or an `owl:DatatypeProperty`.\n* There is some restriction on it as a property.\n \nOnce the Fountain has identified all nodes from the vocabularies, it is prepared to search for the incoming (references) and outgoing (properties) edges for each of them. To do so, it creates and keeps a tuple map that puts nodes and their properties together:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?c ?p WHERE {\n    { ?c rdfs:subClassOf [ owl:onProperty ?p ] }\n    UNION\n    { ?p rdfs:domain ?c }\n    FILTER (isURI(?p) && isURI(?c))\n}\n```\n \n",

Look-ups may take unexpectedly long or may not be answered at all.\n* Restrictions on clients such as sercing only a limited number of requests per second (rate limits).\n",
