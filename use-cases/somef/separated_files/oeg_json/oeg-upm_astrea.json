            "excerpt": "Astrea is a software capable of generate SHACL shapes from one or more given ontologies. It relies on a set of equivalences between the [OWL2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) constructs and the [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) constructs, which are exploit by means of a set of [SPARQL queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/). The idea behind Astrea is to rely on a set of mappings between such specifications, and a list of queries so by just applying the queries over one or more owl files the associated shapes can be generated. \nIn this repository the software provided imports all the ontologies associated to the construct owl:imports for an input ontology, in addition in its methods counts with the option of importing more than one ontology URL to generate their shapes. Consider that the shapes generated are associated only to the types and properties specified in the ontology, therefore providing more than one URL can be useful if one ontology references elements from another but it does not import it. \n",
