The idea is to ease and encapuslate the complexity of the library to work with a simple API to exploit the two main components of the original library: Gazetteers and Jape Rules. \nThe idea of the library is to work as a microservice web API in which you configure only declare and configure the main processes and you receive the annotations of the document in a JSON document. Easy to integrate and use with other NLP libraries of the domain to be invoked by other languages as Python.   \n",
