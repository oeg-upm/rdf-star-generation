            "excerpt": "Morph-Skyline is an RDB2RDF engine for skyline queries developed by the Ontology Engineering Group, that follows the R2RML specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/).  \nSkyline queries are preference-based queries, which were proposed by B\u00f6rzs\u00f6nyi et al. [1] extending SQL by means of a SKYLINE OF clause as follows: SKYLINE OF d1 [MIN | MAX],..., dn [MIN | MAX] where where di denote the dimensions of the Skyline, and MIN and MAX specify whether the value in that dimension should be minimised or maximised. \nMorph-Skyline extends Morph-RDB and it supports two operational modes: data upgrade (generating RDF instances from data in a relational database) and skyline query translation (SPARQL to SQL). Morph-Skyline has been tested on synthetic datasets using the data generator provided by B\u00f6rzs\u00f6nyi et al.[1]. At the moment, Morph-Skyline works with EXASol. \nThis repository contains code of the engine and a set of general experiments to test perfomance, scalability and completeness of our approach.\nAdditionally, for the ISWC'20 demo-paper \"Morph-Skyline: Skyline Queries for Virtual Knowledge Graph Access\", the resources and results can be found in the [demo-paper folder](https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-skyline/tree/master/demo-paper) \n",
