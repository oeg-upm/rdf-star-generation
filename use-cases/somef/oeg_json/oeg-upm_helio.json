The translation of data into RDF can be performed using different tools from the literature, or the Helio materialisation engine. Additionally, the RDF produced is injected automatically in a triple store and can be versioned. Finally, Helio offers also the necessary components to publish the RDF at resource level, dataset level, and enables a SPARQL endpoint. Nevertheless, Helio also allow users to define dynamic views of the data and associate html views that may have embedded RDF (RDFa). \n",
