The current features are:\n * Serialise:\n\t * Serialise any Thing Description as a Java Object, i.e., a JDT\n\t * Serialise a JDT from a JSON-LD framed document\n\t * Serialise a JDT from a set of RDF triples\n * Round trip-translation:\n\t * Translate from a JSON-LD framed document into a set of equivalent RDF triples\n\t * Translate a set of RDF triples into its equivalent JSON-LD framed document\n * Validation \n\t * Validate a JTD using [SHACL shapes](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)\n\t * Validate a JTD using [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)  **(coming soon)**\n\t * Validate a JTD according to the [restrictions specified in the standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/)  **(coming soon)**\n\n\nIf you have any feedback or feature suggestion, please let us know posting an issue with the label <span style=\"color:#EFA914\">**feedback**</span>\n",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\\n\\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\\n\\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\\n\\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
